Note! One problem I am having is inconsistency and lack of focus, so things don't seem to stick. See the Kaggle Jupyter sample file - it's Markdown headings - it seems to be going through things,  SYSTEMATICALLY CLEANING UP COLUMN BY COLUMN.


1- Data cleaning: - Use string slicing and string methods to change columns like 'Size', 'Installs', 'Price', ... to numbers - Remove duplicate rows

2- Inspect the data, calculate some statistics and write some comments on interesting observations. 
- Which are the top 10-20 most installed (reviewed) apps? 
- Do you see any weird app? 
- Which are the top 10-20 most expensive apps? 
- Which popular apps (100,000+ installs) are disliked the most?

3- Visualize and comment on some or all columns. For example: 
- Pick a few interesting columns and make a pairplot. 
- Do you see any interesting scatterplot? 
- Which categories have the most apps? Which categories are most popular (by installs)? 
- What is the range of application size (maybe using a boxplot?) 
- Visualize the distribution of price for paid apps only 
- Plot the Content Rating column

4- More possibly interesting questions to explore: 
- Shows the relationship between price, rating and category (pick only 5 categories) 
- Do free apps have more installs than paid apps on average? 
- Which categories appear the most among top 100 most expensive apps? 
- Can you show the top 100 most common words that appear in apps name?

5- Ultimately, even without predictive analytic, your report should have at least 1 actionable recommendation. You could: 
- Pick a category/genre and answer this question: If I want to develop an app in this domain, what should I remember? - Or a more general question: I want to be a mobile dev, what is a good advice for me?

Remember to comment something after you produce a statistic table or chart to summarize the results or discuss things that you found interesting.

Communication is also an important skill in data analysis. Without meaningful summary and comments, people won't understand your beautiful chart.
